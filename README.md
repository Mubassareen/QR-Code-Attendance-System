# QR-Code-Attendance-System
A QR-based attendance system is developed using Google AppSheet. The application enables users to scan their unique QR codes for attendance, automatically storing their details (name and date) in Google Sheets. The system maintains two sheets: one for the full list of applicants and another that records attendance by date. Also, it registers the abcentees.
