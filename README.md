# QR-Code-Attendance-System
A QR-based attendance system using Google AppSheet for the Summer Takaful 6 program. The application enables users to scan their unique QR codes for attendance, automatically storing their details (name and date) in Google Sheets. The system maintains two sheets: one for the full list of applicants and another that records attendance by date.
